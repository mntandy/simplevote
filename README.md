A webapp written in JavaScript based on ReactJS and NextJS with server-side rendering.

The app allows registered users to create sessions to which they can invite others to vote for one or more options.

Users can either have their own CSS style or use a standard style. The only current user, "jammin", has their own css style. There is more work to be done on the standard style. This would include a general logo.
